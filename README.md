# PWM-Signal-Generation-and-Monitoring-System

**Objective**

The primary objective of this project is to design and implement an embedded system using the STM32F0 Discovery board to monitor and control a PWM signal generated by a 555 timer. The system allows for dynamic adjustments of the PWM frequency by varying the control voltage, while also measuring and displaying the frequency and voltage on an OLED display. A button interface is incorporated to toggle between displaying the frequency and control voltage, providing an intuitive and user-friendly means to observe real-time system behavior. Additionally, the system is designed to measure and display the effects of voltage changes on the PWM signal's frequency.

**Functional Requirements:**

The system must measure and display the frequency and voltage of the PWM signal generated by the 555 timer.

The system must allow the user to dynamically adjust the voltage via a potentiometer to observe the effect on the 555 timer's PWM frequency.

The system must display the measured values (frequency and voltage) on the OLED display.

The button must toggle between displaying the 555 timer's PWM signal and the external signal from the signal generator.

The system must display both the frequency and voltage for both the 555 timer's signal and the signal generator on the OLED display when toggled.

The system must allow the user to control the frequency and duty cycle of the PWM signal using the optocoupler, driven by the STM32F0's DAC.
